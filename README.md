# Favourite Places IOS app made with Swift / SwiftUI.
### Made by Sean Fowers

This is an application i made for the 3701ICT Mobile Application Development course.
In this course we developed 2 IOS apps and took a final exam to display our knowledge of Swift and SwiftUI.
I achieved a 7 on a scale of 1 to 7 (7 being the highest).

If you would like to see the app working, please view the video below where I explain it and how it works.
